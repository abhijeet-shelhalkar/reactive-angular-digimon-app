This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). 

#### Check out the App here: [Live Preview](https://ngx-digimons.netlify.app/)

It uses both [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for UI components &  [ngx-spinner](https://github.com/Napster2210/ngx-spinner) for the loading spinner. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
